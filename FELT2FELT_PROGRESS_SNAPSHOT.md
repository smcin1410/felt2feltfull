# FELT2FELT Progress Snapshot

## Recent Updates (July 2024)

### Find Lodging Feature & Map Integration
- **Find Lodging:** Users can now search for hotels near trip locations with a filter modal (budget, amenities, priorities) on the Trip Designer page.
- **Google Places API:** Integrated for real hotel data. Results are shown as user-friendly hotel cards with "Book" buttons (affiliate-ready).
- **Interactive Map:** The "Map" tab now displays an interactive Google Map. Destinations and lodging appear as pins.
- **Advanced Markers:** Migrated all map pins to the new `google.maps.marker.AdvancedMarkerElement` API (removes deprecation warnings, future-proofs the app).
- **Lodging/Map Sync:** Clicking a hotel in the lodging modal highlights and centers it on the map.
- **API Key Security:** All Places API requests are securely proxied through a Next.js API route.
- **Frontend Modernization:** All new features use React, Next.js App Router, and modern best practices.

### Strategic Focus
- Prioritize user value: help users find the best trip experience for their budget, not just upsell.
- Build trust and traffic first; affiliate deals and direct partnerships will be added as the user base grows.

## Outstanding/Next Steps
- Make lodging search location fully dynamic (based on selected trip/destination).
- Add more advanced filtering (e.g., by amenities, number of tables, etc.)
- Add sorting options to destinations/tournaments
- Make more fields editable in admin (if needed)
- Connect trip planner to dynamic data
- Add real-time features and additional authentication providers (e.g., GitHub)
- (Optional) Self-host fonts to avoid Google Fonts network issues
- (Optional) Migrate to Places API (New) for even richer hotel data and features

## Troubleshooting Note
- If bulk upload fails, check logs, validate JSON, and ensure request size is sufficient.
- If authentication fails, verify .env secrets and OAuth credentials.
